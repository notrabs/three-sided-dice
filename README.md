# three-sided-dice

Did you ever wonder how thick a coin should be so you can not only decide between two things, but a whopping three? And that without doing heavy maths in your head?

**No?** Fine then just watch the simulation: [Here](https://notrabs.github.io/three-sided-dice/)

#### Too inconsistent?
Increase the steps.

#### Too slow?
Add more threads and remove the speed limit.

#### Too fast?
Flip some coins in real life.

#### Still to lazy?
Enable the autoMode and the simulation will get sentient. Just don´t complain when machines take over.


If you want to mess with the code, I´m really sorry. This was hacked together in an afternoon. If you are still interested, the index.js contains the settings, if you want to increase the available limits. The worker.js contains the multi-threaded physics code. Go there if you are not happy with the physics parameters.
